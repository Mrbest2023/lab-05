Answer for Question 1: dBm is wifi signal strength and a value that is considered good is anything higher than -70

question 2: We need to check it to make sure that it can run the program without issue. the main differences are usually the syntax for certain commands or some commands aren't universal for differnt os. 

Question 3: The check output functions checks to see if the program is sending out data correctly. It returns the data in encoded bits.

question 4: the re.search function searches for signals of a certain dbm and when it finds the level of dbm it returns the data unencoded. 

Question 5: We need to convert it because it can only be read in dbm in windows. 

Question 6:Standard deviation measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. it is useful to calculate because if the standard deviation is big than it means the numbers are more dispersed rather than close together. 

Question 7: A data fram is a data structure that organizes data into a 2-dimensional table of rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. It is useful to store data in one because it will organize the data as it stores it. 

Question 8: it is important to plot the error bars because they give a general idea of how precise a measurement is, or conversely, how far from the reported value the true (error free) value might be.

Question 9: I observed that the data was much stronger in certain parts of my apartment than others. When I was closer to my router the signal was better and the farther I moved from it the worse it got. I think it got weaker because the signal can only go through so many walls and go so far before it starts to lose strength. 

Question 10:
